    <h1>Moi Moi</h1>
    <img src="../receipes/moi moi.jpeg" width="250" height="250">
    <p>Nigerian Moi Moi (also Moin Moin) is a great dish accessory in Nigeria. 
        It is commonly seen accompanying Jollof Rice, Fried Rice, Fried Plantain, Custard, Akamu (Pap, Ogi) etc. 
        It can even be eaten alone as a snack with a chilled soft drink to wash it down.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>3 cigar cups or 750g Beans (Brown/Black eyed)</li>
       <li>5 tablespoons ground crayfish</li>
       <li>4 big stock cubes</li>
       <li>1 habanero pepper</li>
       <li>2 teaspoons ground nutmeg</li>
       <li>3 tatashe peppers or 800g watery tomato puree (sold outside Nigeria)</li>
       <li>2 big onions</li>
       <li>20cl vegetable oil</li>
       <li>2 litres of cool or warm water</li>
       <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend the beans, tatashe or tomato puree, onions, crayfish, habanero pepper and ground nutmeg together with some of the water and pour the mix into a big enough bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the vegetable oil and the bone marrow stock (if this is what you have chosen to add to your moi moi).</li>
        <li>Slowly add the remaining water and stir the mixture at the same time till you get a good mix of all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Add salt to taste and stir very well.</li>
        <li>Pad the base of a big pot, pour some water and set on the stove. The depth of the water should be at most 1 inch.</li>
        <li>Dish the Moi moi mix into containers of your choice, add egg/bone marrow/corned beef to each container, seal/cover and set them in the pot.</li>
        <li>Add as small quantity of water as possible at a time while cooking the Moi Moi as detailed in preparation and use of moi moi containers so that the moi moi will not become watery when done. This is the case especially when using aluminium foil or uma leaves.</li>
        <li>The length of time you will cook your Moi Moi depends on the quantity and the Moi Moi container you used.</li>
